  <h1>Privacy & Security</h1>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect minimal information required for the app to function. This may include medication schedules, reminders, and optional profile details you provide.</p>

  <h2>Where data is stored</h2>
  <p>Data is stored locally on the device by default. If you enable cloud sync (if available), data will be stored on the service specified in the app settings.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data on our servers and during transmission. However, no system is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>User control</h2>
  <p>You can delete your data from the app settings. For data deletion requests, contact <a href="mailto:support@pilltimer.com">support@pilltimer.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Local-only storage and deletion</h2>
  <p>By default, the app stores user data (for example medication schedules, reminders, and any photos you attach) locally on your device only. We do not transfer or use this data on our servers or for other purposes unless you explicitly enable cloud sync or otherwise opt in. When you uninstall the app from your device, locally stored data is removed from the device and is no longer retained by the app.</p>

  <p>If you enable a cloud sync feature (optional), data may be uploaded to the service you choose; in that case we will clearly state which service is used and request your consent.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and use of data for product improvement</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics (Google) to collect anonymous usage and diagnostic data in order to improve and maintain the application. Analytics data is used only for product development, crash analysis and usage metrics. Any data sent to these services is used solely for improving the app and is not sold or used for advertising purposes by us.</p>

  <h2>No secondary use or retention</h2>
  <p>All data you create or input in the app (medication schedules, reminders, profile information, photos, etc.) remains on your device by default and is not transferred to our servers or used for any secondary purposes. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute your personal or app data. If you enable optional cloud sync, we will ask for consent and explain how that service stores your data.</p>

  <h2>Developer disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The app is provided as a personal reminder and management tool and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for medical decisions. The developer is not responsible for any damages, loss, or injury that may result from using the app. By using the app you acknowledge that it is an assistive tool and that you follow healthcare and legal guidance applicable in your jurisdiction.</p>
